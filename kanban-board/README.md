## 📚 About This Project  

Built shortly after completing CDAC, this project was a self-driven effort to deepen my understanding of React-based UI interactions, state management, and drag-and-drop workflows.

While simple in scope, it highlights several important frontend skills:  
- Implementing drag-and-drop using `react-beautiful-dnd`
- Structuring components with clean logic and layout
- Managing UI state and interactivity with `useState` & `useEffect`
- Styling with Tailwind CSS for a utility-first approach

> 🕒 Organized and published later for clarity, learning, and portfolio presentation.

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) : Utility-first framework for responsive design without writing custom CSS.

## 🔄 What Came Next

This Kanban board project marked a key transition from frontend learning to building complete, real-world applications with deeper interactivity and structure.  

After this, I began building **full-stack applications** with **ReactJS** and **Spring Boot**, adding real API integrations, role-based auth, database persistence, and modular monolithic structures.

📌 **Explore my pinned GitHub repositories to see full-stack platforms built beyond the academic phase.**

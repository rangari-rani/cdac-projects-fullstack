## 📚 About This Project  

Built shortly after completing CDAC, this project was a self-driven effort to deepen my understanding of React-based UI interactions, state management, and drag-and-drop workflows.

While simple in scope, it highlights several important frontend skills:  
- Implementing drag-and-drop using `react-beautiful-dnd`
- Structuring components with clean logic and layout
- Managing UI state and interactivity with `useState` & `useEffect`
- Styling with Tailwind CSS for a utility-first approach

> 🕒 Organized and published later for clarity, learning, and portfolio presentation.

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) : JavaScript library for building interactive UIs with reusable components. 
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) : Utility-first framework for responsive design without writing custom CSS.

# 🎓 Academic Projects – PG-DAC (CDAC)

Welcome to my curated collection of full-stack projects inspired by the **Post Graduate Diploma in Advanced Computing (PG-DAC)** — an authorized training center under **CDAC (Centre for Development of Advanced Computing)**.  
 
> 💡 _Some implementations were refined post-training to reinforce concepts and expand hands-on experience._   
> 📚 _Later organized and published for transparency, learning, and portfolio presentation._
